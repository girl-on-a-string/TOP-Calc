# TOP-Calc

My August 2024 goals were soley to finish this calculator. I spend around a month and a half (august and part of july) on it before deciding to leave it on the back burner to move onto other things. 

Right now (8/31/24) it can only do simple operations with 2 integers (ex. 8 + 8 or 45 + 42) but not with multiple (ex. 33 + 43 + 54). The clear button also works. Everything else I kind of got to work but I ran out of time. I'll probably try to finish it eventually. 

I learned a lot on this project. I went from understanding basically nothing and panicing for basically 2 weeks to being fairly confident dispite the problems I couldn't fix in time. I feel MUCH more confident in my abilities to figure out the logic of a task now.
